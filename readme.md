# Evently: Event Manager 
Evently is a full-stack web application designed to help people create, discover, and manage events. The goal was to build a clean, fast "Command Center" where event organizers can see exactly how their events are performing, while users get a smooth experience finding and booking tickets.

## Tech Stack:
I chose these specific tools because they work well together for a fast, modern app:
    - Frontend: React with Vite (for speed) and Tailwind CSS (for the "Glassmorphism" look).
    - Icons: Lucide-React for those sharp, consistent UI elements.
    - Backend: Node.js and Express. It’s lightweight and handles many requests easily.
    - Database: SQLite. I used this because it's a "file-based" database—perfect for a project like this where you want reliability without the overhead of a massive server.
    - Auth: Clerk. This handles all the login/security stuff so I could focus on the actual event features.
